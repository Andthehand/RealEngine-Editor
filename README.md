# RealEngine-Editor

**RealEngine-Editor** is the official game editor for **RealEngine-V2**. It provides a visual interface for creating, managing, and testing game projects built with RealEngine-V2.  

While **RealEngine-V2** is the underlying engine library, RealEngine-Editor offers the tools you need to interact with your projects without writing engine-level code.

## About

RealEngine-Editor is designed to separate the engine from the development tools. This allows developers to:

- Use RealEngine-V2 directly as a library if they prefer code-based workflows.
- Use RealEngine-Editor for a more visual, user-friendly experience when building games.

> For the underlying engine, see [RealEngine-V2](https://github.com/Andthehand/RealEngine-V2).
